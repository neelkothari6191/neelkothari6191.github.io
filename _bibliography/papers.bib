abstract = {A spoof-aware speaker verification system is an integrated system 
that is capable of jointly identifying impostor speakers as well as spoofing 
attacks from target speakers. This type of system largely helps in protecting 
sensitive data, mitigating fraud, and reducing theft. Research has recently 
enhanced the effectiveness of countermeasure systems and automatic speaker 
verification systems separately to produce low Equal Error Rates (EER) for 
each system. However, work exploring a combination of both is still scarce. 
This paper proposes an end-to-end solution to address spoof-aware automatic 
speaker verification (ASV) by introducing a Deep Reliable Spoof-AwareSpeaker-Verification (DR-SASV) system. The proposed system allows the 
target audio to pass through a “spoof aware” speaker verification model 
sequentially after applying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based spoof 
detection model. The suggested system produces encouraging results after 
being trained on the ASVSpoof 2019 LA dataset. The spoof detection model 
gives a validation accuracy of 96%, while the transformer-based speech 
verification model authenticates users with an error rate of 13.74%. The system 
surpasses other state-of-the-art models and produces an EER score of 10.32%.},

abstract = {According to the WHO, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the seventh most common cause of death worldwide as of 2023. The early identification of AD is difficult, and there are currently no known preventative procedures. It is crucial to develop an accurate computer-aided system for the early detection of AD to help AD patients. One of the most promising areas for the early identification of Alzheimer's disease is neuroimaging, and early diagnosis is crucial for determining the creation and efficacy of treatment alternatives. To do so, the authors propose a novel architecture which is a Deep-learning centric, computationally efficient and is an integrated Early Alzheimer's Disease detection system. A joint autoencoder-latent vector-based classification system is proposed. Specifically, a convolutional autoencoder is used to generate a latent vector. This latent vector is further passed through a Latent Classifier module (LCM) to be classified using the Deep Parallel Ensemble (DPE), consisting of 5 base classification models: SVM, Random Forest (RF), Extra-Trees Classifier (ETC), XGBoost (XGB), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The system is trained and tested on a 5-class Alzheimer’s dataset consisting of high-resolution MRI images. The proposed system “EADDA” gives a testing accuracy of 86.57%, being the only work exploring and experimenting with the ADNI 5-class dataset.},

abstract="Potholes on roads are a widespread problem, causing damage to 
vehicles and endangering lives of drivers. Traditional methods for detecting 
potholes involve manual inspections, which are time-consuming and expensive. 
This research presents a novel approach to detect potholes on roads using 
accelerometer data. Accelerometer data can be collected using low-cost sensors 
and processed using machine learning algorithms to identify potholes 
automatically. The proposed approach involves collecting accelerometer data 
from a vehicle as it drives over a road surface. The data is processed using SVM 
to identify features that are indicative of potholes, such as sudden changes in 
acceleration or vibrations. The algorithm is trained and tested on secondary and 
primary datasets using labeled data to detect potholes accurately. Experimental 
results during training and testing on primary data show that the SVM is effective 
at detecting potholes with an accuracy of 93.3 %. Pothole detection could be 
faster and cheaper with this method, leading to better roads and less risky driving 
conditions for drivers. This research demonstrates the feasibility of using 
accelerometer data to automate pothole detection, providing a promising avenue 
for future research in this area.",

abstract="Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is one of the most critical diseases in today's day 
and age and its accurate and thorough diagnosis is the need of the hour. This work aims to 
accurately predict CKD in a patient with the help of machine learning by developing a robust 
Artificial Neural Network model which would vastly benefit the Healthcare industry. It takes into 
account every criterion and predicts whether the subject may encounter CKD or not. An empirical 
comparison of the efficiency of various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest 
Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Stochastic 
Gradient Boosting, Cat Boost Classifier, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, and Decision Tree 
Classifier is also portrayed in this research. The algorithms implemented on preprocessed data 
gave accuracies of not more than 95%. This work has implemented a modified Artificial Neural 
Network which predicted whether a patient has CKD or not with an accuracy of 98%, which 
surpassed that of all the other classification algorithms that were compared. The proposed model 
may serve as an effective and accurate tool to predict the occurrence of CKD in a patient.",
