abstract={The healthcare industry relies on efficient and fast decision making. This paper aims to expand the Fog
computing and Distributed computing domains to optimize quality of service (QoS) in order to facilitate IoT based
healthcare applications with low latency requirements and developing a smart fog gateway equipped with an optimized
fog algorithm. The purpose of this study is to optimize real-time healthcare data processing using Fog computing,
ensuring dependable, rapid decision-making while minimizing delays caused by data transmission and computation.
This is also known as Health-as-a-service (HaaS). We conduct an electrocardiography (ECG) analysis utilizing three
computing paradigms: Cloud computing, Fog computing, and a heterogeneous distributed Fog computing setup
employing the dynamic OptiFog algorithm. This algorithm effectively manages computational resources within the
distributed Fog environment, utilizing Raspberry Pi clusters to enhance performance during worst-case scenarios. The
response time is measured using Short Message Service (SMS). The OptiFog node exhibited a response better than
the Fog node and the cloud node. The OptiFog algorithm not only takes into account different computing parameters
like number of cores, memory usage, CPU utilization and response time of the computing node but also assigns
dynamic priorities to these parameters to get the best possible processing available. Based on the workload of the
task/node, it dynamically decides the job size to save the network bandwidth and to reduce the network overhead. In
conclusion, the proposed work demonstrates that optimizing Fog computing with the dynamic OptiFog algorithm is
an effective approach to meet low-latency requirements in IoT-based healthcare applications making it a valuable
addition to the Health-as-a-Service (Haas) framework for real-time healthcare data processing.

abstract = {A spoof-aware speaker verification system is an integrated system 
that is capable of jointly identifying impostor speakers as well as spoofing 
attacks from target speakers. This type of system largely helps in protecting 
sensitive data, mitigating fraud, and reducing theft. Research has recently 
enhanced the effectiveness of countermeasure systems and automatic speaker 
verification systems separately to produce low Equal Error Rates (EER) for 
each system. However, work exploring a combination of both is still scarce. 
This paper proposes an end-to-end solution to address spoof-aware automatic 
speaker verification (ASV) by introducing a Deep Reliable Spoof-Aware Speaker-Verification (DR-SASV) system. The proposed system allows the 
target audio to pass through a “spoof aware” speaker verification model 
sequentially after applying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based spoof 
detection model. The suggested system produces encouraging results after 
being trained on the ASVSpoof 2019 LA dataset. The spoof detection model 
gives a validation accuracy of 96%, while the transformer-based speech 
verification model authenticates users with an error rate of 13.74%. The system 
surpasses other state-of-the-art models and produces an EER score of 10.32%.},

abstract = {According to the WHO, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the seventh most common cause of death worldwide as of 2023. The early identification of AD is difficult, and there are currently no known preventative procedures. It is crucial to develop an accurate computer-aided system for the early detection of AD to help AD patients. One of the most promising areas for the early identification of Alzheimer's disease is neuroimaging, and early diagnosis is crucial for determining the creation and efficacy of treatment alternatives. To do so, the authors propose a novel architecture which is a Deep-learning centric, computationally efficient and is an integrated Early Alzheimer's Disease detection system. A joint autoencoder-latent vector-based classification system is proposed. Specifically, a convolutional autoencoder is used to generate a latent vector. This latent vector is further passed through a Latent Classifier module (LCM) to be classified using the Deep Parallel Ensemble (DPE), consisting of 5 base classification models: SVM, Random Forest (RF), Extra-Trees Classifier (ETC), XGBoost (XGB), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The system is trained and tested on a 5-class Alzheimer’s dataset consisting of high-resolution MRI images. The proposed system “EADDA” gives a testing accuracy of 86.57%, being the only work exploring and experimenting with the ADNI 5-class dataset.},

  abstract={In the recent past, Quantum theory has taken over a plethora of fields like quantum chemistry, quantum optics, and quantum computing. Another such application is Quantum Internet. With the help of quantum physics, the innovative idea of Quantum Internet aims to make communication safe and effective. However, there are several fundamentals that need to be understood before Quantum Internet can be fully realized. Despite the ceaseless scope and potential extent of Quantum Internet, not all remain aware about it and research and experimentation in this field is yet to reach worthwhile levels. In this contribution, we study a plethora of related articles and issues and conduct and advanced survey explaining the importance of Quantum Computing and its need in the modern world. We elicit the advantages and disadvantages of Quantum Internet and explain its working. This review also explains the relation of Quantum Computing with 5G and 6G. We list the various performance parameters of Quantum Internet and explain the parameters that affect its performance. },

abstract="Potholes on roads are a widespread problem, causing damage to 
vehicles and endangering lives of drivers. Traditional methods for detecting 
potholes involve manual inspections, which are time-consuming and expensive. 
This research presents a novel approach to detect potholes on roads using 
accelerometer data. Accelerometer data can be collected using low-cost sensors 
and processed using machine learning algorithms to identify potholes 
automatically. The proposed approach involves collecting accelerometer data 
from a vehicle as it drives over a road surface. The data is processed using SVM 
to identify features that are indicative of potholes, such as sudden changes in 
acceleration or vibrations. The algorithm is trained and tested on secondary and 
primary datasets using labeled data to detect potholes accurately. Experimental 
results during training and testing on primary data show that the SVM is effective 
at detecting potholes with an accuracy of 93.3 %. Pothole detection could be 
faster and cheaper with this method, leading to better roads and less risky driving 
conditions for drivers. This research demonstrates the feasibility of using 
accelerometer data to automate pothole detection, providing a promising avenue 
for future research in this area.",
