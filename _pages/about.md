Hi! I am currently a Master's Degree student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) majoring in Computational Science and Engineering.
My research interests and experiences lie in various applications of Machine Learning, Data Science, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, Generative AI.  

### Research Collaborations

    <h3>2024-Present</h3>
    <p>
  Involved in NLP research, investigating Cultural Biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) with <a href="https://cocoxu.github.io/#advise" target="_blank">Dr. Wei Xu</a> [NLP X Lab]
</p>

  <div class="timeline-item">
    <h3>2023</h3>
  <p>  
 Got involved with <a href="https://simppl.org/team" target="_blank">SimPPL</a>, a research collective primarily based in the Global South that develops open-access trust and safety tools for international organizations, including nonprofits and newsrooms.
  Here, guided by 
  <a href="https://swapneelm.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Swapneel Mehta</a>, I developed robust and efficient solutions driven by social trust and safety, addressing problems related to the mitigation of misinformation, disinformation, and Deepfakes. We aim to build better civic integrity tools such as 
  <a href="https://parrot.report/about" target="_blank">Parrot Report</a> and 
  <a href="https://sakhi.simppl.org/" target="_blank">Sakhi</a>. We collaborated with the Anti-Defamation League, Tech Global Institute, The Sunday Times, Ippen Media, and Deutsche Welle. Our work has received support from the Wikimedia Foundation 
  (<a href="https://meta.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCred/2022_CFP/Audit_the_Impact_of_Credibility_in_Online_Information_Ecosystems" target="_blank">WikiCred</a>), 
  <a href="https://research.google/outreach/explore-csr/recipients/" target="_blank">Google exploreCSR</a>, AWS, the NYC Media Lab, 
  <a href="https://www.goethe.de/prj/aia/en/index.html" target="_blank">AI2Amplify</a> (German Federal funding), and the NYU Tech Venture Workshop.

    <h3>2022</h3>
    <p>
  Got involved in long-term research as a Machine Learning Intern at the 
  <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology-Patna (IIT-P)</a>, guided by 
  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raju-Halder" target="_blank">Dr. Raju Halder</a> and 
  <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=DsGb9mgAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Medhasree Ghosh</a>, where I experimented with temporal graphs, time-varying 3D matrices, Graph Neural Networks, and using models such as Autoencoders, CNNs, LSTMs, RNNs, BERT, GRUs, and GANs on Ethereum data to interpret the evolving behavior of phishing/fraudulent users.
