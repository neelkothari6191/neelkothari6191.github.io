Hi! I am currently a final-year undergraduate student at [Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering](https://www.djsce.ac.in/) majoring in Computer Engineering.
My research interests lie in Computer Vision, Generative AI, Deep Learning, Machine Learning and developing robust and efficient algorithms/ solutions driven by social trust and safety and problems related to mitigation of misinformation.
I have worked on deepfake-detection, action-recognition, image-segmentation, speech-recognition and medical imaging among other machine learning problems involving classification and predictive modelling. 

I have been involved with [Dr. Pratik Kanani](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pratik-Kanani) in long-term research in the domain of Computer Networks, particularly providing low-latency solutions for healthcare/ social applications.
I am advised by [Dr. Kiran Bhowmick](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kiran-Bhowmick) in my undergrad dissertation on Deepfake Detection and collaborate closely [Prof. Ruhina Karani](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ruhina-Karani) in Computer Vision research solving multimodal classification problems.
I have also collaborated with [Dr. Aruna Gawade](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IMFy_ugAAAAJ&hl=en) in Medical Imaging, [Dr. Ramchandra Mangrulkar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ramchandra-Mangrulkar) in Image Encryption.

I have also been involved in long-term research as a Machine Learning Intern at the [Indian Institute of Technology-Patna (IIT-P)](https://www.iitp.ac.in/), guided by [Dr. Raju Halder](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raju-Halder) and [Medhasree Ghosh](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=DsGb9mgAAAAJ&hl=en) where I experiment with temporal graphs, time-varying 3D matrices, Graph Neural Networks and using models like
Autoencoders, CNNs, LSTMs, RNN, BERT, GRUs, GANs on Ethereum data to interpret the evolving behavior of
phishing/fraudulent users.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.test

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
